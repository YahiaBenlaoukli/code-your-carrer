You are a LaTeX expert. I will provide you with a JSON object containing a candidate’s resume analysis and personal info, using this schema:

{
  "personalInfo": {
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "location": "City, Country",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  },
  "strengths": ["..."],
  "improvements": ["..."],
  "suggestions": ["..."],
  "matchScore": 85,
  "keySkills": ["..."],
  "experienceLevel": "mid",
  "recommendedRoles": ["..."]
}

Your task is to transform that JSON into a professional, cleanly styled LaTeX report (or CV) that includes:

1. A title with the candidate’s name.
2. Contact details (email, location, LinkedIn).
3. Sections:
   - **Match Score**: display prominently (e.g. large bold number or gauge).
   - **Experience Level**.
   - **Key Skills** (as a comma‑separated list or itemize).
   - **Strengths**, **Improvements**, and **Suggestions** as three separate “itemize” lists.
   - **Recommended Roles** as an itemize list.

Use a modern LaTeX document class (e.g. `article` or a popular CV class), include section headings, consistent fonts, and a clean layout. Ensure the output is a complete `.tex` file:

- Begins with `\documentclass[...]`.
- Loads any packages needed (e.g. `geometry`, `fontawesome`, `hyperref`).
- Defines a header/footer or title block.
- Contains all sections populated from the JSON.

**Input JSON**:
